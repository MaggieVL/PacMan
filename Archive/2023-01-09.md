* 2nd day of the project `done`
* Article https://dahoum.wales/the-pacman-as-a-nursery-32ba07b282b1 `ml`
* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself, do not search for ready code in the internet.
  * The goal is the skill, not the result. The result should demonstrate the skill.
  * Always begin by analysing the original game (eg. Google PacMan and play the Google doodle) and asking yourself "How can I do this w/ HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
  * Make small steps. Sometimes you will be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Do not get lost. Make small steps.
* Homework
  * Show the sprite sheet w/ HTML `ml`
  * Place one PacMan on top of the labyrinth w/ CSS `ml`
  * Try to move the PacMan around `ml`
* Done
  * tried multiple ways of displaying other images from the sprite sheet, but all of them appeared as blank icons - tried finding out why but it was not successful, finally ran an example that does it successfully and hope I can do it tomorrow the right way
  * found some useful videos on sprite animations for the 'move PacMan part'
