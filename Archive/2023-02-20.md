* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself
    * Do not watch videos
    * Do not read articles
    * The only thing you can look up is use of HTML tags, CSS tags and JavaScript commands/syntax
  * The goal is to develop your skills, not the result
  * Make small steps
    * And we improve them
    * Every day you should have progress w/ breaking the existing progress
* Total reset and from the beginning 30 Jan
* Maggie's features
  * I need to see the big picture and what tools I can work with first so that I can analyse the task better and see the steps ahead
  * perfectionism - find balance with pragmatism
* Tips
  * animate with js, don't do it with css, this animation should be in a game loop and with time we will make it okay
  * find 3 docs for html, css, js - book time in the gantt - read them 3 times - every day i should have progress and should read some docs
* Homework
  * make pacman switch the respective animations when changing directions (when an arrow key is pressed)
  * animate the ghosts
  * make the ghosts move up and down in their cage before leaving it
  * make PacMan identify walls and the borders of the board
* Done
  * scaled the orange ghost looking up
  * reversed all scaling and went back to the original proportions (as discussed with T.E.Shaw, this can be done later if needed, but is not important now)
  * animated all pacman versions (up, down, left and right animations), set pacman's start position (and start image - the full circle), made pacman use the right animations when going in different directions (show pictures of him going left, when we change his direction to left, the same applies for the other directions), made those animations connected right - the new photos start showing from where the previous ones stopped showing, they don't start from a completely random different position on the board
