* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself
    * Do not watch videos
    * Do not read articles
    * The only thing you can look up is use of HTML tags, CSS tags and JavaScript commands/syntax
  * The goal is to develop your skills, not the result
  * Make small steps
    * And we improve them
    * Every day you should have progress w/ breaking the existing progress
* Total reset and from the beginning 30 Jan
* Maggie's features
  * I need to see the big picture and what tools I can work with first so that I can analyse the task better and see the steps ahead
  * perfectionism - find balance with pragmatism
* Tips
  * animate with js, don't do it with css, this animation should be in a game loop and with time we will make it okay
  * find 3 docs for html, css, js - book time in the gantt - read them 3 times - every day i should have progress and should read some docs
* Homework
  * move the board in the center of the screen
  * make the board bigger and more 'readable'
  * adjust PacMan's size based on the size of the tunnels in the new board
  * change direction of Pacman movement correctly (now it continues in the current direction and the new one, we want it to continue only in the new direction)
  * use the real arrows to move pacman
  * make PacMan identify walls and the borders of the board
  * animate the pacman w/ javascript
  * place this inside a game loop (read the article) 
* Done
  * moved the board in the center with flexbox but don't think it was okay, so I tried with the position property that is already used to style the tag and don't think it was helpful enough either, so i started reading a css tutorial to cover the first half of the points 
  * use the real arrows to move pacman
