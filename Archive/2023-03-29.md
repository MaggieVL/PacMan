* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself
    * Do not watch videos
    * Do not read articles
    * The only thing you can look up is use of HTML tags, CSS tags and JavaScript commands/syntax
  * The goal is to develop your skills, not the result
  * Make small steps
    * And we improve them
    * Every day you should have progress w/ breaking the existing progress
* Total reset and from the beginning 30 Jan
* Maggie's features
  * I need to see the big picture and what tools I can work with first so that I can analyse the task better and see the steps ahead
  * perfectionism - find balance with pragmatism
* Tips
  * animate with js, don't do it with css, this animation should be in a game loop and with time we will make it okay
  * find 3 docs for html, css, js - book time in the gantt - read them 3 times - every day i should have progress and should read some docs
* Homework
  * make the ghosts recognise the walls (all without the red one)
  * make all the ghosts chase pacman in their own way
  * make the ghosts turn blue when pacman eats a power pellet
* Done
  * worked on the algorithm for the movement of the red ghost - the chasing of pacman
