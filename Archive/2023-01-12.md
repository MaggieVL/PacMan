* 5th day of the project
* Article https://dahoum.wales/the-pacman-as-a-nursery-32ba07b282b1 `ml`
* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself, do not search for ready code in the internet.
  * The goal is the skill, not the result. The result should demonstrate the skill.
  * Always begin by analysing the original game (eg. Google PacMan and play the Google doodle) and asking yourself "How can I do this w/ HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
  * Make small steps. Sometimes you will be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Do not get lost. Make small steps.
* Homework
  * Try to move the PacMan around `ml`
* Done
  * made PacMan move in the main directions using the keyboard
