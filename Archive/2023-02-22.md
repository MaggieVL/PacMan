* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself
    * Do not watch videos
    * Do not read articles
    * The only thing you can look up is use of HTML tags, CSS tags and JavaScript commands/syntax
  * The goal is to develop your skills, not the result
  * Make small steps
    * And we improve them
    * Every day you should have progress w/ breaking the existing progress
* Total reset and from the beginning 30 Jan
* Maggie's features
  * I need to see the big picture and what tools I can work with first so that I can analyse the task better and see the steps ahead
  * perfectionism - find balance with pragmatism
* Tips
  * animate with js, don't do it with css, this animation should be in a game loop and with time we will make it okay
  * find 3 docs for html, css, js - book time in the gantt - read them 3 times - every day i should have progress and should read some docs
* Homework
  * animate the ghosts
  * make the ghosts move up and down in their cage before leaving it
  * make PacMan identify walls and the borders of the board
    * make the ghosts do it as well
  * make Pacman eat the coins
    * make the score go up every time he does so
  * make each ghost move in its individual way towards Pacman
* Done
  * made the red ghost move and switch direction randomly without the arrow keys having been touched 
  * wrote the coordinates of the tunnels in an array - for the 'make pacman recognise the walls task'
    * changed the width and height of the ghost so that they can fit into the tunnels
