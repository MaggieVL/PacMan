* 3rd day of the project `done`
* Article https://dahoum.wales/the-pacman-as-a-nursery-32ba07b282b1 `ml`
* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself, do not search for ready code in the internet.
  * The goal is the skill, not the result. The result should demonstrate the skill.
  * Always begin by analysing the original game (eg. Google PacMan and play the Google doodle) and asking yourself "How can I do this w/ HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
  * Make small steps. Sometimes you will be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Do not get lost. Make small steps.
* Homework
  * Show the sprite sheet w/ HTML `ml`
  * Place one PacMan on top of the labyrinth w/ CSS `ml`
  * Try to move the PacMan around `ml`
* Done
  * showed all sprite icons w/ CSS (in Safari they show okay, in Chrome there is a 'broken image' icon on them that needs to be removed) (realised later on that (maybe all) the icons placed in the labyrinth paths (moving or not) should probably be the same size or sth => more adjustments later if needed)
  * watched videos and read blogposts on animations in order to move the icons
