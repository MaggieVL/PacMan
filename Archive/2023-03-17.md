* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself
    * Do not watch videos
    * Do not read articles
    * The only thing you can look up is use of HTML tags, CSS tags and JavaScript commands/syntax
  * The goal is to develop your skills, not the result
  * Make small steps
    * And we improve them
    * Every day you should have progress w/ breaking the existing progress
* Total reset and from the beginning 30 Jan
* Maggie's features
  * I need to see the big picture and what tools I can work with first so that I can analyse the task better and see the steps ahead
  * perfectionism - find balance with pragmatism
* Tips
  * animate with js, don't do it with css, this animation should be in a game loop and with time we will make it okay
  * find 3 docs for html, css, js - book time in the gantt - read them 3 times - every day i should have progress and should read some docs
* Homework
  * display the score using sprite sheet icons
  * make the ghosts recognise the walls
  * make the red ghost chase Pacman in its own way - directly
    * make all the ghosts chase pacman in their own way
    * link the chasing with the explosion and game reset at the end
  * optimise the coin-eating further
* Done 
  * optimised pacman movement - now it's the fastest possible (time and memory-wise) and doesn't slow down 
  * there was a problem with the coin-counting - even when a coin is already gone, it was still counted - i fixed that, it's now okay
  * made the background of the browser window the same color as the labyrinth's background
