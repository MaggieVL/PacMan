* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself, do not search for ready code in the internet.
  * The goal is the skill, not the result. The result should demonstrate the skill.
  * Always begin by analysing the original game (eg. Google PacMan and play the Google doodle) and asking yourself "How can I do this w/ HTML, CSS and JavaScript."
  * Make small steps. Sometimes you will be overwhelmed by the possibilities. Do not get lost. Make small steps.
* Homework

  * Show the spirte sheet in HTML `ml`
  * Show only the full labyrinth w/ CSS `ml`
  * Place one PacMan on top of it w/ CSS `ml`
  * Try to move the PacMan around `ml`
