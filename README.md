* Mantra
  * Do everything yourself
    * Do not watch videos
    * Do not read articles
    * The only thing you can look up is use of HTML tags, CSS tags and JavaScript commands/syntax
  * The goal is to develop your skills, not the result
  * Make small steps
    * And we improve them
    * Every day you should have progress w/ breaking the existing progress
* Total reset and from the beginning 30 Jan
* Maggie's features
  * I need to see the big picture and what tools I can work with first so that I can analyse the task better and see the steps ahead
  * perfectionism - find balance with pragmatism
* Tips
  * animate with js, don't do it with css, this animation should be in a game loop and with time we will make it okay
  * find 3 docs for html, css, js - book time in the gantt - read them 3 times - every day i should have progress and should read some docs
  * divs.html - red, blue, yellow divs and check positions and flex, labyrinth, pacman, container
  * move the containers center
* Homework (in order of execution)
  * make the centering of the board and all sizes of images in the correct unit so that they are better adjusted to the environment around them
  * make PacMan identify walls and the borders of the board
  * animate the pacman w/ javascript
  * place this inside a game loop (read the article) 
* Done
  * made the labyrinth and pacman responsive but realised that I should make the movements and everything not fixed but adapt differently to the page and for a game it doesn't look that natural, I saw one pacman game page and the background was totally fixed, didn't respond, I think this is better, but i should definitely think more about how i position the pictures, what units and all
